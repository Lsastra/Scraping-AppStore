19,Napicola,we-star-rating-stars we-star-rating-stars-4,12/31/2016,Change the Star System!,"It's a fun game, but as previous reviewers mentioned, you have to have enough stars to move on to the next chapter, which is extremely hard. You'll be forced to spend your money on various upgrades and purchase diamonds to continue. Otherwise, you're constantly playing the same game to reach the magical number of stars. Would suggest having a function that allows us to buy diamonds with the profits from the ramen store."
20,TazKats,we-star-rating-stars we-star-rating-stars-4,09/01/2014,Good game,Fun.

55,Dengeist,we-star-rating-stars we-star-rating-stars-4,08/16/2013,Memory&Reflex,"Fun little game. Starts you off nice and easy, by the third stage things start to become a challenge. The only minor problem is the translation in the storyline. It's ""All your base belong to us"" bad, but other than that, really fun game."
56,xXxAngelicLightxXx,we-star-rating-stars we-star-rating-stars-5,08/18/2016,Fun and addicting,Only doing this for a diamond

61,vickieheully,we-star-rating-stars we-star-rating-stars-5,06/24/2014,Ramen Chain is fun!,"I too am a fan of the Dash franchise. I found Ramen Chain to be just as fun. You basically take orders and cook ramen recipes for the customers. The graphics are pretty on my iPad. Gameplay starts off slow as you learn, but it gets challenging after awhile. Lots of things to unlock and upgrades to buy with in-game currency to upgrade your restaurant. Plenty to keep you interested and playing. The storyline is also cute. Highly recommend!"

75,Hyposy,we-star-rating-stars we-star-rating-stars-4,09/23/2013,Review,"I think this game is great since I've playing for couple months yet have not gotten rid of it yet.
I think it's awesome, but I am hoping that there would be more game scene in the future. Say, more Japan cities, more varieties of guest and ramen chef."

78,GeeTee1234567890,we-star-rating-stars we-star-rating-stars-4,08/06/2013,Pretty good game but some bugs,"The major bug I found is you can't purchase at the shop using the available diamonds.
Another issue is when you drag food too fast, it doesn't work so you'd end up throwing the order away."

102,anabearie,we-star-rating-stars we-star-rating-stars-4,06/21/2015,Fun,"A really fun time management game, with great graphics, but I'd love to see more shop options. Furthermore, it seems impossible to get three stars on some levels without using diamonds, which is kind of unfair."

110,Vivrekt,we-star-rating-stars we-star-rating-stars-3,01/07/2016,Cool,It's not the best food franchise game. The food takes too long to get into the bowl when you drag it. And it's hard to get more customers into the restaurant when you have all the upgrades.

I don't like how you have to get so many starts for the next level. You almost have to have all perfect games."
113,Adrian Lee,we-star-rating-stars we-star-rating-stars-4,08/19/2014,Not bad,"Not bad, interface could be a little larger for the fingers bit overall a good time waster"

116,Jr Slzr,we-star-rating-stars we-star-rating-stars-4,08/29/2015,Nice idea.,"Fun game but would be better if it had more levels and in depth game play especially with the restaurant. Ex: more upgrades, making restaurants bigger, etc."

Note for anyone who gets frustrated with the need to buy or wait for diamonds: You can use your ¥ to boost each store, which increases your profits and gets you to 120 stars without acquiring diamonds."

The only flaw I've encountered is, sometimes at the end of a round, it will stay on the screen. The only way to ""fix"" it is to exit the app completely, which means you lose all progress made in that round, stars, and money. Also, the game exits itself randomly at times. I will continue to play it. I wish there were more levels though!"

The tips are flashed too quickly between levels so you can't read them in time. You also can't get three stars on all levels unless you purchase diamonds, which is to be expected. Fun story line and characters."

A downside is that in order to fully upgrade equipment, it requires gems (like most games) but the ONLY way to get them is to buy them. No way to naturally win a gem here or there for those who don't want to pay for in app purchases. Also a couple translation issues. Other than that, great game :)"

But!
It does not have enough levels, so after you finish all levels with 3 stars (i did it in about 6 days, 2 hours daily), you have to delete the app or wait for updates, nothing entertaining will be left."

The best thing is you don't have to rely on having life points, it's unlimited playing. Upgrading items isn't too difficult but maybe collecting diamonds is. You get one free diamond every 24 hrs."
445,Xoxonene612,we-star-rating-stars we-star-rating-stars-5,08/31/2015,Hungry,"Yeah it's fun and all, but I really want ramen while I'm playing this game. Which is usually at work. The fact that I can't eat ramen while playing this game makes me insanely hungry and frustrated and makes me want to get all three stars on every stupid level to ease the emptiness in my stomach. Why does it have to look so delicious? Seriously, please turn down the illustrations so I don't have to eat ramen all day every day I'm playing this game."

487,Omgthisisnutz,we-star-rating-stars we-star-rating-stars-4,05/24/2016,Ramen chain,"The game is fun, but you cannot move on to the upper levels unless you earn enough stars. And that means you almost have to have a perfect game in order to open the airport area. I would rather they just let us move on without this restriction. In order to collect diamonds which can buy you valuable boosts, you either have to wait 24 hours for a free diamond or write a review like I am doing now to get one. This distracts from the fun of playing the game. And I guess we all know why the game was created in the first place. Not necessarily for our pleasure, but for the creators to make money."

508,Pants please,we-star-rating-stars we-star-rating-stars-2,08/09/2013,Doesn't function well.,"I would like to give it a better review, but I can't. The game is fun and I like the background stories. The problem is it's hard to tap on anything. I originally thought the problem was my phone, then I tapped the pause button and it worked without a problem. I can't serve customers (who are also hard to tap on) when I can't tap on them because the drink/ stock menu's won't get off of the screen."

510,RamenChef,we-star-rating-stars we-star-rating-stars-3,05/14/2017,Wasting time,Nice for wasting time. Not easy but you learn to earn coins and buy upgrades. But then you need diamonds that need to be purchased. It's a bit of the bait you in then get you hooked enough to buy things in the game.

The only troubles are really some funny typos, which I understand as this was made in India, but also that everything is really tiny on iPod touch, so it's hard to grab the right thing, or anything at all at times, but I manage. Great fun."
